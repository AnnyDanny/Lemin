I have names of rooms in linked list and in every element i have connections with every room. 
I need to find path from start to end on the connections which connect every room with other room.
So, at first I add pointer to start room to new linked list, which consist for queue, 
then I check which pointers consist my connect and point from start room to room, which pointer consist in connect. 

or

1. add start room in queue. List of queue - its t_list.
2. That variable, which point on start - that variable we use.
3. Till queue not equal null, start external cycle.
4. In external cycle we start inner cycl, which leaf list with connections.
5. In inner cycle we ask, if check point equal null - we write in check point more on one value, than in parent check point.
6. Also we need to check, if element of lists end or not end.
7. We need to write function "pop", which will move head on one element. Head its queue.
8. End write a "push" function, which add element in queue.

**tail alwais point on end element.
